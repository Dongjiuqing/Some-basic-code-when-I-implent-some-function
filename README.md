# own_code
This folder include some codes which writen during my learning and work. Just some experience of mine.

Maybe the most useful is data augmentation, show bounding-box on image, I guess.

if you want to use some code, the library is easy to install. 

Most library can be installed by using pip install **** or conda install ****

I am a Chinese, so some files I annotate the code with Chinese.
